I am working on a Vue 3 + Vite project with the following structure:

- Main entry: src/main.js
- Router: src/router/index.js
- i18n: src/i18n/index.js
- Main layout: src/layouts/MainLayout.vue
- Components: src/components/
- Views: src/views/
- SCSS variables: src/assets/styles/_variables.scss
- SCSS main: src/assets/styles/main.scss

I want to [describe your goal or problem here, e.g. "add a new feature", "fix a bug", "implement pagination", "make the navbar responsive", etc.].

Here are the requirements:
1. [List any specific requirements, e.g. "The navbar should only show on desktop", "Add a dark mode toggle", "Show 5 blogs per page", etc.]
2. [Add more requirements as needed.]

If you need to see any file, let me know and I will provide its content.

Please provide:
- Step-by-step solution.
- Grouped code changes by file, using concise code blocks.
- Only show changed/new code, use `// ...existing code...` for unchanged regions.
